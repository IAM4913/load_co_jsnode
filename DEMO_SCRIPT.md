## Demo Flow (15-20 minutes total)

### **Opening (1 minute)**
*"Let me show you how this system will transform your load coordination operations. What you're seeing is a live, working system that's ready for immediate deployment."*

### **1. Dashboard Overview (3 minutes)**

**What to Show:**
- Status summary cards at the top
- Load grid with real data
- Modern, clean interface

**Script:**
*"The first thing you'll notice is the executive dashboard view. These summary cards give you instant visibility into your operation - 5 Open loads, 4 Ready, 1 Assigned, and so on. This is real-time data that updates automatically as your team works. Notice how the interface automatically adapts to mobile devices - the cards stack vertically on phones and tablets for easy viewing."*

- Column sorting and filtering

**Script:**
*"The grid automatically sorts loads by business priority. Open loads always appear first because they need immediate attention. Notice the color coding - yellow for Open, blue for Ready, green for Assigned. This visual system helps your team prioritize instantly."*

*"Watch this - I can edit information directly in the grid. Let me assign a driver to this Ready load..."* [Demonstrate inline editing]

*"Notice how it automatically changed from Ready to Assigned status when I added a driver. The system understands your business logic."*

**Key Points:**
- Business-logical sorting
- Visual priority indicators
- Inline editing efficiency
- Automatic status updates

### **3. Load Details Deep Dive (5 minutes)**

**What to Show:**
- Click on a load to show detailed view

- Line-item management
- Trailer number validation
- Status progression

**Script:**
*"Now let's dive deeper into a specific load. Click on any Load ID to see the complete details."*

*"Here's the comprehensive view - Load ID, Ship From location, the Requested date (not just when it was created in the system), current status, and assigned carrier."*

*"Below that, we have every line item with descriptions, quantities, and individual status tracking. Your team can mark items as Loaded or Marked Off with reasons."*

**Key Points:**

- Responsive forms and details

**Script:**
*"The system is fully responsive and optimized for mobile devices. Watch as I resize the window to show mobile view..."* [Demonstrate mobile breakpoint]

*"On mobile devices, the navigation transforms into touch-friendly tabs, and the load grid switches to an intuitive card-based view. Each load is displayed as a card with all key information visible at a glance."*

*"Users can still edit data directly on mobile - driver names, trailer numbers, and status updates all work seamlessly with touch input. The mobile interface maintains all the functionality of the desktop version while being optimized for smaller screens."*

**Key Points:**
- Fully responsive design
- Touch-optimized interface
- Mobile-specific navigation
- Maintains full functionality

### **5. Document Generation (3 minutes)**

**What to Show:**

*"The system also generates Bills of Lading with all customer and routing information, plus CSV exports for your accounting systems."*

**Key Points:**
- One-click document generation
- Professional formatting
- Multiple export formats
- Integration ready

### **5. Role-Based Access (2 minutes)**

**What to Show:**

*"Notice how Jordan users only see Ready, Assigned, and Shipped loads - exactly what they need for their carrier operations."*

**Key Points:**
- Role-based security
- Organization-specific filtering
- Appropriate access levels

### **6. Bulk Operations (2 minutes)**

**What to Show:**

- Bulk status updates
- Efficiency demonstration

**Script:**
*"For high-volume operations, watch this efficiency feature. I can select multiple loads and update their status in one operation."* [Demonstrate bulk update]

*"This transforms what used to be minutes of individual updates into seconds of bulk operations."*

**Key Points:**
- Bulk efficiency
- Time savings
- Scalable operations
